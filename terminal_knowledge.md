Which terminal client did you choose and why?

I chose iTerm2 because it is highly customisable, has split panes, can review history of past commands, and many more.

What customisations (if any) did you make?

I added a Starship prompt and two plugins via homebrew: autosuggestions and syntax highlighting. I also included some aliases to speed up some actions: ll for ls -lah, gs for git status -sb, gc for git commit -m, gp for git push, and .. for cd ..

What was the most useful command you learned today?

I played around with a few of the commands and I found the open . command is the most useful because I don't have to manually navigate through Finder, and it is also extremely versatile. I can use different variations of open, like for example, if I want to open the current folder on VS Code, open a URL in my browser, etc.
