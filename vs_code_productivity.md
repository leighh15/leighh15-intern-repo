My top 10 shortcuts on VS Code:

Run Cell — shift+command+enter
Run Below — option+command+enter
Format Code — shift+option+F
Search Across Files — shift+command+F
Go to Definition — F12
Multi-Cursor Add Next Match — command+D
Column (Box) Selection — shift+option+command+up/down
Open Integrated Terminal — ⌃+`
Toggle Comment — command+/
Command Palette — shift+command+P

In my work, I will probably find shift+command+enter the most as this is essentially the same as pressing "Enter" but for programming.

Once I master the keyboard shortcuts on VS Code, it will boost my productivity by minimising time on running certain functions as it can be down simply through the shortcut. Therefore, I can improve my efficiency and get more meaningful work done.
