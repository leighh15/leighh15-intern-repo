Which extensions did you install and why?

I installed all the required extensions, namely:

React Developer Tools - I installed this extension because it allows me to inspect the React component hierarchies.

Redux DevTools - I installed this extension to see actions/state changes and use time-travel debugging.

JSON Viewer Pro - I installed this extension because it can beutify API responses so theyâ€™re readable and searchable.

Lighthouse - I installed this extension because it can "audit" my web app to improve the performance, quality and correctness of it.  It can run tests to see how well the page performed. 

What was the most useful thing you learned?

I think running lighthouse is the most useful thing I learned among the four.
