Which extensions did you install and why?

I installed all the required extensions, namely:

React Developer Tools - I installed this extension because it allows me to inspect the React component hierarchies.

Redux DevTools - I installed this extension to see actions/state changes and use time-travel debugging.

JSON Viewer Pro - I installed this extension because it can beutify API responses so theyâ€™re readable and searchable.

Lighthouse - I installed this extension because it can "audit" my web app to improve the performance, quality and correctness of it.  It can run tests to see how well the page performed. 

What was the most useful thing you learned?

I think running lighthouse is the most useful thing I learned among the four. Below I've added a screenshot of a summary report for Youtube, specifically the performance of the site. We can see that Youtube actually failed in performance, but presented satisfactory results in other areas. Lighthouse provides insights as to what caused the poor performance and also diagnostics to improve.
