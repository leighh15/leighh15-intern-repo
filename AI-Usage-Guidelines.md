Research and Learn:

Reliance on AI has increased dramatically the last few years and this may be due to the new breakthroughs and improvements over the years. While AI can support productivity in the workplace, it is important to use it thoughtfully and understand the potential it has to access sensitive information if not used right. 

A common AI tool for my role is OpenAI. In conjunction with other modes of support, OpenAI supports me in formatting my codes and troubleshooting where possible. In a professional setting, benefits of AI include improved efficiency and productivity. Mundane tasks can take time to do, so allowing AI to support these tasks can give us more time to focus on more complex work. AI can also support in optimising schedules and automate routine tasks, as well as provide insights on how we can make better use of our time. AI also has the power to analyse data at incredible speeds and aid in decision-making, but as we try to ensure and exercise cyber security, this may be considered a risk in the workplace, especially when it comes to confidential data and information. Over-reliance on AI is also a potential risk. Employees may start to lose autonomy in their work and skill gaps may not be addressed as soon as it should. Tech issues may also occur as a result of AI use. 

We should never provide sensitive information to AI, particularly personal information of our customers as well confidential information about our work. We should also never copy-paste codes to ensure complete security of our work. AI-generated content should always be validated and never trusted blindly. Fact-checking can be done by comparing with your own work, and asking your colleagues for their own review. At the end of the day, AI-generated content should act as guidance to your own, human work. It should not be the validator of your work.  

Reflection:

As mentioned previously, AI should only serve as a tool and not the sole creator of our work. For example, I would use AI when I need support in writing up code, providing me a foundation on how I should structure my work. My own skills should take over when I then use this AI-generated code in my own work and apply my dataset and adjust the code as needed. In this case, I allow AI to streamline the process of establishing my code without having to check many different sources and combining them all in one. Of course, this should also serve as a learning process for me, so in the future, I no longer need to seek assistance from AI, especially if it's things that frequently come up in my role. 

I believe I can avoid over-reliance on AI by only using it for mundane tasks and basic level guidance. I believe the complexity of my work should be done by myself only and not with the help of AI so that I can consolidate my own skills. 

To ensure utmost privacy for our data and information, I will:
1. As much as possible, rely on my skills to do my work.
2. If the assistance of AI becomes necessary, provide only generic prompts to help with my work.
3. If anything becomes unclear regarding what can and can't be entered into AI tools, ask the team or supervisor for guidance.

Task:

The prompt was:
'I have a dataset with 15 variables, and 200 observations. 2 of them are just nominal, 13 of them continuous metric. How should I begin my data visualisation and cleaning? Can you use R programming language?'

ChatGPT provided me a code for the prompt they were given. However, I know for myself that ChatGPT's code structure is different to what I am used to. Syntax is also incorrect in some areas, although I know many programming languages will send an error message if I try to use them, some mistakes may still pass if I am not careful.

I use the generated answer as a starting point, edit areas where I want my code to look more familiar and I am more able to expand if I need to. Since ChatGPT does not know the findings from visualising the data, I then have figure out how to proceed and work with the data myself. 

One best practice I will follow when using AI tools while working at Focus Bear is using only basic prompts to support my work and checking with my supervisors if I have doubts with any of the prompts I may use.
