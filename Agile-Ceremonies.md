There are four main Agile ceremonies, all with different purposes:

Daily Stand-ups: A short meeting held daily to keep everyone informed and in the same page, and coordinate their work. 

Sprint Planning: A scrum ceremony is a time-boxed event where the team defines the sprint goal and determining what work they can accomplish in the sprint. It takes place on the first day of a sprint.

Continuous Prioritisation: A kanban concept where the team continuously reviews and prioritises specific tasks and removes unnecessary or not needed tasks. 

Retrospectives: A meeting held at the end of a sprint where the team reflects on the performance during that sprint, and discuss any room for improvements for the next one. 

Backlog refinement: It is the process of reviewing, ranking and editing backlog. It is usually done before sprint planning so that backlog can be taken into consideration when planning the sprint.

Agile teams can include people from all over the world and may not all work at a particular time. These teams can still collaborate asynchronously by focusing more on the outcome and performance rather than the presence of since we cannot expect someone to be present when they are on the other side of the world. It is also important that every task, activity, meeting, etc are well-documented. It would also be ideal for communication to occur through email and chat so team members can answer at a time appropriate for them.

For my role as a data analytics intern, I believe the most important ceremony right now are the daily stand-ups. Being an intern, processes are still new to me so it is important that I am informed daily of the things that need to be done. 

I attended a stand-up meeting on Friday 8th August at 3pm through Google Meet. Each team member were given a few minutes to provide a progress update to the rest of the team. I personally shared my progress with the rest of the team, any blockers I have at the moment, and I was given some goals to complete within the next few weeks. 

I also reviewed a retrospective from Front-End team which occured in April this year. It was done through Miro. They had some icebreakers in the beginning before proceeding to the main agenda where the team answered the following questions:
- What went great?
- How did we support each other?
- Could anything be done better?
- What are the priorities for the next sprint?
- Who stood out this sprint?

I think it was quite insightful looking at a past retrospective given I have yet to participate in a sprint, let alone a retrospective. I believe I understand now what is expected of me during a sprint. 

One change I can make to improve my team collaboration is by actively participating in the ceremonies and not being afraid to speak up. I think this will be incredibly helpful not just for the rest of the team to understand where I fit in the team, but also for myself if I experience any challenges that the team will be able to support me.
