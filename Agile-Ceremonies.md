There are four main Agile ceremonies, all with different purposes:

Daily Stand-ups: A short meeting held daily to keep everyone informed and in the same page, and coordinate their work. 

Sprint Planning: A scrum ceremony is a time-boxed event where the team defines the sprint goal and determining what work they can accomplish in the sprint. It takes place on the first day of a sprint.

Continuous Prioritisation: A kanban concept where the team continuously reviews and prioritises specific tasks and removes unnecessary or not needed tasks. 

Retrospectives: A meeting held at the end of a sprint where the team reflects on the performance during that sprint, and discuss any room for improvements for the next one. 

Backlog refinement: It is the process of reviewing, ranking and editing backlog. It is usually done before sprint planning so that backlog can be taken into consideration when planning the sprint.

Agile teams can include people from all over the world and may not all work at a particular time. These teams can still collaborate asynchronously by focusing more on the outcome and performance rather than the presence of since we cannot expect someone to be present when they are on the other side of the world. It is also important that every task, activity, meeting, etc are well-documented. It would also be ideal for communication to occur through email and chat so team members can answer at a time appropriate for them.

For my role as a data analytics intern, I believe the most important ceremony right now are the daily stand-ups. Being an intern, processes are still new to me so it is important that I am informed daily of the things that need to be done. 

One change I can make to improve my team collaboration is by actively participating in the ceremonies and not being afraid to speak up.
