Reflection:

I think Focus Bear was created to address the gap in productivity tools available in the market because they fail to accommodate the needs and routines of people with AuDHD.

Focus Bear aims to solve the challenges faced by neurodivergent people when it comes to productivity. ADHD can negatively affect productivity when people become hyper-focused and find it difficult to detach from it. Additionally, they may also find themselves with a lack of focus and easily distracted from social media and other forms of entertainment. Even people without ADHD are increasingly struggling to concentrate, especially when faced with chaotic schedules. Especially with the increasing popularity of short form entertainment, it is easier than ever to lose focus when our brains become accustomed to only short periods of focus.

I think this mission is important because reduced productivity on a macro level have huge economic impacts. Additionally, people with AuDHD deserve to have a place in a productive society, and Focus Bear can assist in making sure they can contribute in whatever career or job they are in. 

I value tools that are rooted from a genuine need and not just built for the possibility of wants. I believe apps should be designed to support people in their daily lives and not hinder their capabilities and potential. 

Personally, I struggle with maintaining a routine. I tend to take action only when it becomes dire, and I become hyperfixated, losing the will to commit to other, potentially more important, things. For example, I may be hyperfixated on a certain hobby for a few weeks, or a TV series that I am determined to watch the whole way through. Meanwhile, I could be preparing for an exam that's happening in a few weeks. Focus Bear can help to keep me accountable for my decisions, especially digitally.
