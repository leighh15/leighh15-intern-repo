Agile vs Traditional Project Management

Agile is a set of methods and practices where solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organising, cross-functional teams. The main differences between Agile and traditional project management are as follows:

Agile:
- Focused on continuous delivery
- Adaptability to change
- Customer and internal collaborations

Traditional:
- Focused on set processes and tools
- Rigid plan and averse to change
- Contract negotiations

Agile Core Values and Principles

Agile has 4 core values and 12 principles:

Core Values:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- responding to change over following a plan

Principles of Agile:
- Satisfy customers through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
- Welcoming changing requirements, even late in development
- Deliver working software frequently, preferring shorter timescale
- Business people and developers daily collaboration
- Build projects around motivated individuals and supportive environment
- Encourage face-to-face conversation to promote efficient communication
- Working software is the primary measure of progress
- Sustainable development and maintain constant pace
- Attention to technical excellence and good design
- Simplicity is essential
- Self-organising teams
- Regular team reflection on better effectiveness and adjust accordingly

Scrum vs Kanban

Kanban: more "flexible"
- visualising workflow through kanban board
- meetings are less critical in day-to-day work
- no designated roles
- more accepting of change
Kanban can be used when work is unpredictable and continuous, 

Scrum: more "structured"
- work in cycles called "sprints"
- hold regular meetings like stand up, sprint reviews, retrospectives
- defined roles: scrum master, development team, product owner
- avoids major mid-sprint changes
Scrum can be used when work can be broken into smaller parts

Focus Bear leans more towards the Kanban framework because it emphasises a continuous and more flexible workflow. The team can benefit from real-time adaptability and being able to handle ongoing tasls.

Reflection:

Key benefits of Agile include: continuous feedback and continuous delivery, flexibility, promotes ownership and self-management, embracing change.

Key challenges of Agile include: requires strong discipline across the team, some individuals may be less adaptive to constant change, some individuals may struggle to adopt Agile values, especially if coming from the traditional context.

Agile principles can help to improve my role and responsibilities by being able to adapt to changes, as well as being able to collaborate more effectively. Regular reflections can also help to address setbacks before it becomes critical and will encourage me to take ownership and deliver quality work. 

Task:

Scrum and Kanban are two frameworks that implement the Agile principles. Kanban is a more flexible approach to project management. It focuses on continuous workflow with no designated roles or time-boxed events. Tasks are pulled from a kanban board generally with three parts: to-do, doing, done. This framework makes it more flexible and is ideal for teams with ongoing workloads. Scrum, on the other hand, is time-boxed and teams work in short cycles called "sprints". Here, they have defined roles and tasks that need to be completed within the sprint. Teams also hold regular "ceremonies" like stand up, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. It is a more structured enforcement of the Agile principles. One Agile principle that I think will be most important to my work is the principle of continuously delivering valuable software to satisfy our customers. It is important that I aim to find solutions to ensure our customers continuously experience improvement in their experience with our product.
