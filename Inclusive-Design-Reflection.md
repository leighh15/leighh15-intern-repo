Research and Learn:

Vulnerable populations include people who face a higher risk of facing social or health disadvantages compared to the general population due to some factors like illness, disability, age, culture, race, etc. Particularly in digital spaces, some vulnerable populations may experience challenges. People with ADHD and Autism for example may have difficulty using digital mediums that may be overstimulating, the elderly population may struggle to use highly advanced technologies, those who experience vision and hearing loss may require additional accessibility features. 

When it comes to designing and working with neurodivergent individuals, it is important first and foremost that we listen to their needs, and should not assume that what we think is best is actually best for them. It is also important to understand that neurodivergent people all have different needs and preferences, hence designing an app like Focus Bear should be something that can cater to a wide range of cognitive styles. We should avoid creating challenges for neurodivergent people that we might consider to be normal, that is, being mindful of any sensory overloads, ensuring fair access to learning and development, being open to different working styles. 

As mentioned before, we need to understand that people with ADHD and Autism may require more accessibility to cater to their needs and preferences and this includes clear and simple interfaces, personalisation to suit their preferences, avoid over-stimulating visuals, concise language, and more. We can support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting by respecting different working styles and allowing the flexibility to work in different ways. 

Reflection:

Since I will be working with and for neurodivergent people, I should first be able to adapt to what works best for them. I need to be able to adjust my communication style to be more inclusive. I should use clear and literal language, and avoid overloading with information. Being aware of my tone and respecting different emotional expressions is also important.

Some common UX/communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive include overstimulating interfaces. We should avoid too many design elements that might deter our customer base from using it. Focus Bear should also be able to cater to many different ways of thinking and working. We should not have rigid to-do lists with only 1 way of visualisation, and instead allow the user to customise our product that works best for them. For example, being able to visualise this to-do list in a singular list, grouped lists, with tags, labels, or in a visual board, etc. Another super common pitfall that many apps face is an overwhelming onboarding. An overwhelming start to their usage of our app will deter them from using it any further so we should introduce features as it is being used. One practical change I can make is to be a concise as possible and avoid hidden meanings, going out of topic, information dumping.

I read a Medium article by Kathleen Haagenson listing her favourite productivity tools and outlining the features that help boost her productivity. Kathleen lists a digital to-do list app as a good productivity tool. One major design improvement that Focus Bear could implement is introducing a daily to-do list. As part of their morning ritual, a customer may create a to-do list for the day and outline the time they may want to take for each task, and have the focus timer run when they start to do the tasks on the list. In this way, they can keep track of everything they need to do in the app, while also being able to focus and eliminate distractions. If tasks are something they may do frequently, they can also use this as a guide to determine the right amount of time for completing them. 

If a customer writes: " I'm overwhelmed and can't figure out where to start."

We can respond:

"Hello, 

Thank you for sharing your experience and we apologise for causing you to feel overwhelmed. While fix our app interface to better serve you, I will share how you can start using Focus Bear!
