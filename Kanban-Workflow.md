Research and Learn:

A typical Kanban board has three sections: To-Do, Doing, Done. Of course, this can be customised to suit the organisation, but essentially the same process of categorising tasks in order to visualise the work flow of the team. It helps to manage the workflow because it makes it visual and organised, and teams can see exactly what is happening and keep things flowing smoothly.

For example, a Kanban board may have the following columns:

Backlog: backlogs are tasks that are essentially "to-do" and has been planned but yet to begin. 

In-Progress: tasks that are namely in the progress of getting completed. A tasks that has been started will be moved to this column.

Blocked: this column will include the tasks that are in the process of getting done but cannot move forward because of blockers. This column will typically signal to relevant teams that can possibly unblock the progress.

Done: finished work! This means the task has been completed, tested, reviewed and approved.

Tasks move through the board (left to right) when they satisfy the definition of the column. There is no one set to move the tasks along. Whoever is in charge of the task may move it to ensure real time accuracy and autonomy over their work. 

One major benefit of limiting WIP is that it prevents overload and burnout for the team. It also encourages the team to finish existing work before starting new ones. Additionally, because there is limited WIP, more focus and quality is given to each work in progress, enhancing the performance of the team. 

Reflection:

As mentioned previously, Kanban helps to manage priorities and avoid overload by limiting WIP. This gives the team the opportunity to determine which work is most important and work on those first. Since all tasks are on a visual board, the team can understand when there is too much work in progress, helping to prevent overload. Personally, I've utilised a Kanban board in the past, and members of the team are able to judge by themselves if we are working on too many things at once, then it deters them from starting new tasks. 

I can improve my workflow by adapting the following Kanban principles:
- setting strict limits on WIP for myseld to improve the quality of existing work
- review the kanban board daily to reprioritise if needed and to match current progress

Task:

I've reviewed Focus Bear's kanban board and noted that all tasks are updated to the correct status. One way I can improve task tracking in my role is to have clear guidelines as to what makes a certain task "done", that is everyone will know what needs to be completed for it to be considered done. It helps to reduce ambiguity and makes progress tracking easier.
