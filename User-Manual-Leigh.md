User Manual for Leigh Magdamit

My Role

 • I am working as a Data Analytics Intern
 • The days and times I work are: Wednesday 9:00am - 5:00pm, Friday 9:00am - 5:00pm

How I Work Best

 • I do my work best when I am free of distractions! I tend to get side tracked easily, so please try to avoid bringing up random things because I want to stay in the zone
 • I struggle when my colleagues act cold in the work place. I like to work when the energy is positive all the time, so that we can all put in our best work! 

Communication Style

I prefer messages to have as much detail as possible! Please reach out to me (in preferential order) via:

 • Email – I check my emails a lot so I will definitely reply within a few hours. 
 • Discord – I know we have discord for quick comms, but unfortunately I am not very familiar with it

In case of emergencies, call my mobile number! If you think you will need it, I will send you my phone number~

Collaboration & Teamwork

 • I work best in a team when we all contribute and share our thoughts. I thrive when we give each other constant feedback.
 • My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is when someone says “it’s up to you” :D I would like it if we all share our opinions and back it up so that the whole team can agree on the best course of action. A strong group of individuals = a strong team.
 • If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means I am still unfamiliar either with the work itself or the meeting agenda. In this case, I am probably trying to absorb as much of the meeting as I can.

Focus & Productivity

 • I stay focused by having only the tabs I need open.
 • Things that distract me include: rabbit videos, checking time and calendar, youtube, interesting looking furniture, travel plans
 • The best way to support my productivity is allowing me to stay focused for short periods of time, say 25-30 minutes at a time, completely free of distractions. 

Feedback & Growth

I would like it if feedback is:

 • Direct and Private: if it involves only my work specifically and will barely apply to other people. For example, my work includes some mistakes that for sure no other people will make because it is not relevant to their role.
 • General and Public: if it involves things I may have done, but can also apply to other people. For example, I blindly clicked a malicious link, which could happen to anyone, and further reinforces the need for the entire team to be vigilant.

Personally, I would also like feedback to not only include the “what” but the “why”. What are the consequences, short and long term, if this feedback is not addressed promptly? I take in feedback better if I understand why.

I appreciate it when teammates brainstorm ideas without hesitations.

Fun Facts & Quirks

 • One thing people often misunderstand about me is: Being rude. I want to come across as friendly as possible, and I am I swear, but I just like to be straight-forward and give feedback straight away. 
 • A fun fact about me is: I start many hobbies, so I know how to do a lot of things. But I also drop those hobbies not long after I start, so I am not a complete expert at those lots of things.
 • My work superpower is: I learn very quickly, so if you teach me how to do something, I will probably be able to help you out in the future!
