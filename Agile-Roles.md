There are four key roles in an Agile Team:

Developers
- An agile team will consist of multiple developers in charge of designing, building, testing and maintaining the product.  

Quality Assurance
- The Quality Assurance is in charge of testing the features ensure quality standards.

Product Manager
- The project manager defines the vision for the product, creates a roadmap and ensures the team focuses on the right tasks. They are also in charge of communicating with stakeholders.

Agile Project Manager
- An Agile Project Manager is in charge of facilitating the Agile process, making sure the team upholds the Agile principles and removes any blockers that may be hindering progress.

There are also other supporting roles like:
- Stakeholders: provides feedback and requirements
- UX designers: ensure seamless usability and user experience
- Customer support: identifies the issues and collates user feedback

As we have learned before, there are two major frameworks under Agile: Kanban and Scrum, and these Agile roles work differently under each one. 

In a Kanban framework, these roles are a little more informal compared to Scrum, focusing on continuous work flow and limiting work in progress. 

In a Scrum framework, these roles are more formally defined, with three of the main roles being: Scrum master, product owner and development team. The Agile roles will hold regular ceremonies like stand-ups and reviews. 

Reflection:

My role as a data analytics intern is understanding how users interact with Focus Bear. I contribute to the Agile process as a supporting role, where I gather data for analysis. I support developers and QA in determining whether certain features have an effect on some performance metrics. I also support the product manager in visualising the statistics to present to stakeholders for clear presentation. I can also wrangle with internal data like timelines, work processes, and develop insights to support the Agile PM in identifying bottlenecks and pitfalls. One role that the data analytics team may frequently collaborate with is the developing team. I will be frequently analysing data they may find relevant to continuously deliver valuable software to our customers.
