Research & Learn:

Especially in a casual work environment, it is important we distinguish what is professional and unprofessional to foster a healthy work culture. Examples of professionalism include: respectful communication, punctuality, constructive feedback, healthy boundaries, taking initiative, etc. Examples of unprofessionalism include: disrespecting others and the work, dressing inappropriately (dirty, revealing, offensive, etc), slacking off, inappropriate comments and humour. 

In remote teams, respectful communication is vital because we have limited face-to-face communication, we do not have facial cues to determine how the conversation is going. Respectful communication can be done by being mindful of our tone in messages, emails, considering what the recipient will feel reading this message. Avoid being aggressive and sarcastic, especially since this can be viewed more negatively than you might have thought. It also important to keep in mind that we are working in different time zones and working hours, so respecting these can avoid disagreements. It also important we use the appropriate mode of communication, e.g don't write an email regarding a really urgent matter and don't call your supervisor about a non-urgent matter.

Professional feedback allows the continuous development of our people, workplace and product. When giving feedback, we should focus on the action and not the person, and explain why we have given feedback and provide ways to improve if possible. When receiving feedback, we should not take it personally, ask for further clarification if needed, and take it as a stepping stone for future success. 

I've read the suggestions for working with supervisors document to understand the expectations for me. 

Reflection:

I've personally experienced great teamwork and professionalism in my part time job. It entailed everyone having a say on their own and others' responsibilities to determine who has the most suitable skillset for a specific responsibility. Everyone had the opportunity to voice their concerns and everyone took them into consideration. It was also established that we must communicate at all times with each other when tasks overlap or when we face difficulties. At the end, we established an efficient way of working that achieved the best possible outcome. It was effective because we respected each other's strengths and weaknesses and developed an organisational plan that brought the best out of everyone. 

One way to make sure my communication is clear, respectful and inclusive is by minimising tonal language. It is especially important for written communication. It could also be beneficial if I follow a framework for my communication, like the What, Why, How framework, so that my message is clear, concise, and consistent. 

In order to contribute to a positive work environment, I will make sure that I am consistently respectful, always being mindful of what I say and do, supporting other people with their work, giving words of encouragement and light-hearted humour. 

Preparing for a meeting is also vital to ensure they run smoothly, and I can do this by reading the briefing, having questions and ideas prepared, and taking initiative. 

To be proactive during my internship is to do my tasks in a timely manner, making the most out of working with a team, getting involved in projects, asking questions and seeking help if I need to, presenting my own ideas, and developing professional relationships. If I need to follow up with my colleagues or supervisors, I will try to wait a reasonable amount of time and use the appropriate mode of communication. When following up, I will also send in a polite reminder, and if there are deadlines, make sure those are clearly outlined as well. 

I will escalate if the issue at hand is time-sensitive, e.g. if I believe something requires a full day to complete, and there's only 2-3 days left until the deadline. I will also escalate if I've followed up multiple times with no response. 

I will contact my direct supervisor or manager to address the situation and ask for their advice and further steps. It is also important I use neutral language and lay out the facts without sounding accusatory and emotional. 

Some things I won't do include the following:
- I won't ignore messages, especially since they may be important and to respect my teammate's time
- I won't overly use humour in serious discussions; need to find the balance between work engagement and positivity
- I won't disregard deadlines and timelines; many tasks and projects are time sensitive

I've taken note of the CEO's phone number and will make sure to contact if I see breaches of professional conduct and other issues.
