Matplotlib and Seaborn 

Matplotlib is a library that can be used in python and it can generate 2D plots for data visualisation with just simple codes. Though, it can offer a high level of customisation and more control. 

Seaborn is also a library that can generate data visualisations, and is based on the Matplotlib library. It can generate high level of visuals by default compared to matplotlib. Seaborn is said to be easier to learn and use due to less code requirements.

Data Visualisation is important in data analytics because we want to be able to read and understand an entire dataset with a singular picture that can reveal patterns, trends and relationship that may exist within the dataset. This provides a foundation for quicker insights and better decision making. 

With data visualisation, it is important that we use the appropriate charts or graphs for the data we have. For example, we might find histograms useful for continuous variables like duration of app usage, scatterplots if we want to find relationships between two variables. We can also use bar graphs for frequency in categorical variables. 

Matplotlib, as aforementioned, can generate basic level 2D plots for data. Seaborn, on the other hand, can generate more sophisticated visuals that cannot be done through matplotlib. As a data analyst, matplotlib can be used to see for ourselves any patterns and trends for further exploration. However, it would be more appropriate to use the visuals obtained through seaborn for reports and presentation to provide an easier to read graph for non-data analysts.

Focus Bear can benefit from data visualisations to aid in decision making because we can discover trends and relationships and generate insights that can increase our customer base. For example, a scatterplot can reveal a strong relationship between drop-off rate and time spent on the app. If we find that customers drop an app and have spent minimal time on it, then we can determine that app onboarding may be difficult to go ahead with.
