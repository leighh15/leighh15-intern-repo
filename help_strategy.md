## When do you prefer using AI vs searching Google?

I would use AI for the following cases:
- quick help with error messages
- explaining tricky code or APIs
- summarising long docs or issues
- brainstorming ideas
AI's quick generative power can improve my efficiency at work.

I would use Google for the following cases:
- finding official docs and release notes
- checking version specific fixes
- looking at community answers
- comparing tools and approaches
When looking for answers, generally Google searches would be more reliable.

## How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?

I ask a colleague when:
- the issue is about our internal codebase
- the fix affects security, performance, production
- I spent 30min < trying to look for an answer on my own
- if there's a deadline or incident

## What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?

- getting stuck in one idea
- old or wrong answers
- fake APIs from AI
- losing track after a long session
- sharing private info by mistake
- spending too much time
- forgetting to document the solution
