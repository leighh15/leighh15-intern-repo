I installed git locally. I also deided to download and set up GitHub Desktop. The visual interface is easier for me to work with compared to VS Code. It also integrates well with github.com, making it easy and quick to commit changes, see pull requests and resolve merge conflicts.

The most interesting thing I learned about Git is how branches work. You can make changes to a secondary branch where you can develop new ideas and make changes without affecting the main project, and when it's ready, it can be merged back to the main. This encourages safe experimentation with the software and supports collaboration. When changes have been made to the same section of the same file in multiple branches then merged back to main, the team can then review and discuss what changes to keep.
