What I hope to learn from this internship:

I hope to learn and experience first-hand how data analytics plays a part in software development. My academic background, especially in data analytics, revolved around the economy, business insights, insurances, and I'm hoping to see how my skills can be applied to other fields. I am also hoping to learn the processes involved in exploring data, delivering insights and putting it into action. 

What skills I'm excited to develop

I am excited to develop my skills in SQL, as well as enhance my skill in using Python for data analytics. I'm also keen on developing my professional communication because this is my first experience in a professional environment. 

What I believe I can contribute to the team

I believe I can contribute greatly to the team through my organisational and leadership skills. I have strong organisational skills and I am always looking for the most efficient and effective ways to do my work. As such, I can support the team by suggesting better processes and better ideas. 

Room for Improvement

At the moment, I feel I am less confident in my skills in SQL and Python and I aim to improve on it over the course of the internship. I have some experience with Python and no prior experience with SQL. I also have no experience with VS Code. 

What Success Looks Like

In order to say this internship was a success, the following must happen:
- Work-Ready skills in programs like SQL and Python (I can adapt well into a job that requires these skills)
- I had direct influence in the development of Focus Bear (My insights resulted in a delivered work)
- Completed the internship understanding my strengths and room for improvements in order to grow in my career.
