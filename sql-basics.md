## SQL Basics and its importance in data analytics

SQL is the medium that can transform crude data to analysis-ready tables. It can do the following and more:
- Extract data from large relational databases
- Filtering and slicing data that are relevant
- Data aggregration
- Combining tables to see relationships
SQL is widely used for databases across all industries so having SQL skills is highly regarded.

## SQL Functions

I loaded the dvdrental database onto PSQL and experimented with the functions. dvdrental is a sample database representing the business processes of a DVD rental store. The following diagram shows the structure of the database:

Using SELECT function:

The difference between WHERE and GROUP BY:
- WHERE: filters rows

- GROUP BY: combines rows into groups based on a specified value

## Why SQL?

Although Python is powerful for modelling and analyses, SQL is still required for data access and preparation. I can prepare the data through SQL before it enters my Python workspace and it can make work more efficient. It is also used in a lot of departments so collaboration across the whole team will also be more effective.
