Reflection:

Given the information about, the steps I can take to make sure I handle data securely is:
- Use encryption, and only obtain necessary data.
- Store sensitive data in encrypted folders
- Always being wary of suspicious links and emails
- Avoid blindly granting permissions to service providers

As mentioned above, storing sensitive information involves using encryption, restrict access internally, using multi-factor authentication. Sharing sensitive information involves using only secure encrypted services, use strong passwords and change often, limit the time it takes for the information to be seen. Digitally, I should also ensure 100% that I verify the recipients of the information. Disposing of digital data involves using deleting tools that make the data unrecoverable, remove from any backups, keep a note of what was disposed of and when. Physical data should be shredded and disposed of in secure document bins. 

Being one of the senior partners in my paid job, I had the responsibility of protecting the private information of not just our customers but also our employees. Every morning, I would make sure that any customer details such as contact number, banking details, etc, are removed or disposed of or kept in the safe. Every night, I was also responsible for making sure all confidential information are in the safe or in a locked cabinet in the event that an intruder may enter, we limit the possibility of them accessing private information.

Task:

One practice I will adopt to improve data security in my role as a data analytics intern is having a tangible checklist of the procedure for data privacy. That includes, checklist for accessing sensitive data, checklist for sharing sensitive data, and checklist for disposing. It also would be beneficial to have a checklist to make sure the data is infact secure even in times when I don't access it.

One key security measure I will implement moving forward is using only encrypted channels to share confidential data. Regular gmails are unsecure and poses a threat to data privacy.
