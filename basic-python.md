Reflection

I found the last task the most fun, the number guessing game. I enjoy working with if-else statements and because I also did not know the number, it feels like a game for myself as well. 

It was exciting to see my code come to life, and also excited to see myself improve in Python so I can see more interactive and complex code. 

I can imagine some automation through Python can help make daily tasks easier such as checking through to-do-lists, creating reminders, noting deadlines, budgeting, etc. One can simply input things and Python can do the optimisation.
