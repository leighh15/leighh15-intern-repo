## How can combining SQL and Pandas improve data analysis and reporting for Focus Bear?

SQL and Pandas each have their strengths that when combined, I can generate fast and reproducible data analysis reports. Especially when dealing with large datasets, I can utilise SQL by doing fast data manipulations like filters, joins, aggregations. I can prepare the data in SQL in such a way that could potentially take up time and resources if done on Python. Pandas, on the other hand, I have more power to explore, transform and present the data as I see fit. In the context of data analysis and reporting for Focus Bear, this means I can fetch the relevant data through SQL, join tables and manipulate data depending on my needs. Then, I can use Pandas to further analyse, generate more useful information from the data, and create report-ready tables and insights.

As a simple example in the image above, I used SQL to fetch relevant data. Then I used Pandas to create new variables relevant to my analysis, and also print out the results.
