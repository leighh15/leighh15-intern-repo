I reviewed other productivity apps, all under the free trial. Freedom, Tiimo and Routinery have been reviewed through an iOS app, while Cold Turkey was installed through web app.

Freedom: focus sounds (background noise during focus sessions), schedule focus sessions for later or recurring, blog posts about productivity available to read.

Cold Turkey: strict blocking feature, one-time purchase (not subscription), simple set-up, have micromanager feature that blocks all apps except needed ones, good for writers.

Tiimo: onboarding questions: what will the app be used for (organise day and time, remember tasks, stick to routines, etc), neurodivergent on not, calendar import, good visuals, AI assisted, to-do page, calendar page, focus page.

Routinery:
Calendar visual on home page, minimal loading, challenges page (done with other people), habits highly customisable (daily, weekly, monthly - choosing which days of the week - timing of the day), stats easy to see on one screen

What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

Focus Bear, unlike other apps, has the simplest visuals. It is also built specifically for neurodivergent people whereas for other apps, it is just an afterthought. 

If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

If I was a user, I would choose Focus Bear if I simply want to establish good habits. I think focus sessions are common amongst all apps, so Focus Bear would not be too much of a stand-out in that aspect.

What's one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn't?

One feature I noticed that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn't is a calendar integration or feature. I think having a calendar feature built into the app makes it easier for the user to keep track of their days, times, and habits all within the app. 

Based on your research, what's one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

Focus Bear could integrate a calendar feature in the app. I partically liked the interface of Tiimo where they had a To-Do page, Calendar page, Focus page, then Settings. Focus Bear could integrate their Help page into the Settings page and create a Calendar page instead.
