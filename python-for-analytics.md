## How do Matplotlib and Seaborn help with data visualisation?

Matplotlib and Seaborn are two data visualisation libraries with different functionalities. Matplotlib can create basic chart-drawings in Python. It gives full control over the look of the charts but mostly used for simple data visualisation used for further analysis. Seaborn, on the other hand, makes nicer and more modern charts easily (minimal code). Seaborn can create charts that are more presentable.
